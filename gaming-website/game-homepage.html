    <p>The King of Fighters XV[a], also called KOF XV, is a fighting game developed by SNK.
        It was released on February 17, 2022, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. This is also the first game in The King of Fighters series created using Unreal Engine 4, and the first to implement GGPO rollback networking.
     Taking place after the events of The King of Fighters XIV, the narrative primarily revolves around two fighters with multiverse-related supernatural powers, Shun'ei and Isla, among other returning heroes facing revived threats. King of Fighters XV generally received praise for its character roster, team-based gameplay, and smooth online performance, but criticism for its story mode, complex tutorials, and mechanics</p>
