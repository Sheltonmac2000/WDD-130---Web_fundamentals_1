Remember that all the things that will appear in the browser are written within the <body> .
Most tags must have an opening and a closing tag . A closing tag looks like this </body>.
Nesting is when we have tags inside of tags . We have the parent tags and the children tags .
The basic structure of any HTML page always looks like this :
<!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
    <title> Page Title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    *This is where all the stuff that appear in the webpage will be shown. 
    </body>  

</html>

        **Notice that when working with links in HTML the destination of the link goes in the src attribute. Then the part you click on goes inside of the <a> element.
        #attribute names and tags are alwasy in lower case . It is good practice to keep it this way .
        <img src "voyager.jpg" alt = "docking station"> # The image tag does not need a closing tag , because there is no content in between the tags , all the info is inside the attribute.
