*The purpose of a web browser is to display a HTML file . The browser uses the HTML tags to display the content of an HTML file.
*It is crucial to know that tags always have content in between them . That is why there is an opening and a closing tag.
Remember that all the things that will appear in the browser are written within the <body> .
Most tags must have an opening and a closing tag . A closing tag looks like this </body>.
Nesting is when we have tags inside of tags . We have the parent tags and the children tags .
The basic structure of any HTML page always looks like this :
<!Doctype html>
<html lang = "en"> **You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    <head>
    <title> Page Title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    *This is where all the stuff that appear in the webpage will be shown. 
    </body>  

</html>

ELEMENTS
This elements contains the same information for a website . Its always on the top . Things like the menu , buttons etc . 
<header>
    <nav>
    The nave element holds all the headings .
    within the nav element there is an a element.
        <a href = "index.html">Home</a> ##The href is called an attribute . Any addtional information inside of an opening tag is called an attribute ! An attribute is usually followed by an ="value"sign , then the value in quotes.
        <a href = "aboutme.html">About Me</a>
        **Notice that when working with links in HTML the destination of the link goes in the src attribute. Then the part you click on goes inside of the <a> element.
        #attribute names and tags are alwasy in lower case . It is good practice to keep it this way .
        <img src "voyager.jpg" alt = "docking station"> # The image tag does not need a closing tag , because there is no content in between the tags , all the info is inside the attribute. 
</header>        
    </nav>
<footer> 
This contains all the information that stays on the bottom of a webpage . Things liike contact info etc.
</footer>

COMMON TAGS USED IN HTML
<a href = "link.com">Click here to open this link </a> *This is a link tag . It directs you to a specific link on the internet 
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> * You can add width and height to your img tag. Those are additional attributes. Using this means you don't have to size the image differenlty before inserting it .
the alt = "" attribute specifies the name of the image . It may appear in the place of an image if the image does not appear for whatever reason .
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. This can be either an attribute or a tag .
<style></style> or like this <p style = "">Whatever dude</p>
<p></p> *When writing text using the paragraph tag , the browser will automatically create its own whitespaces . So even if i try to create my own like this l        o        v       e      l      i . The browser will ignore this 
<hr> *THIS does not have a closing tag . This tag will seperate sentences inside a paragraph , and it will draw a horizontal line when used.
<br> This is like the /n in python . It will start a new line without havinf to open a new <p></p> tag .
<pre></pre> Using these elements , will not ignore your whitespaces or formatting . The browser will dispaly it exactly as you write it in HTML. BUT, IT COMES WIHT ITS OWN FONT , SO IT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE TEXT .
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.This attribute goes inside the <a>link</a> tag .
i.e <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>


CSS Tutorial
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"> - You must always add the style sheet to the HTML page inside the <head> tag .
Here is the CSS syntax : h1 {color: red; text: bold;} Where h1 is the selector(html tag/element) , semicolons(these are the blocks), attribute is preceded by a : and followed by a value of the attribute.
.heading is a selector that calls a class. (Put period , followed by the name of the class)
p.subtitles - Here there is both an element and a class. This specifies a specific class within a specific element.
#names - This selector is for selecting an id . Put a #, followed by the name of the id . ID names should never start with a number.
* The asteriks selects all the elements within the body tag . Everything in that tag will be edited . This is the universal selector . Just put the * followed by {}
h1 , h2 , p - This will group all these selectors . They will all have the same styles applied to them simulatanouesly . Simply seperate the selectors with a "," to group them .

Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;

*There is a difference between the id selector and the class selector .Only an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it.
However, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.
