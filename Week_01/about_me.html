        <h2>Shelton Macamo</h2>
            <p>I was actually born in Maputo , Mozambique , but I grew up in Johannesburg , South Africa .</p>
            <p>I am a computer science major , and I love programming because it is one of my favorite things to do . I also like playing videogames and watching Marvel movies . I hope to become a software engineer someday.</p>
            <p>Well , in high school , my friends used to call me Shelly as a nickname , but that just sounds weird , so I don't really have a nickname </p>
            <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho are the people ! Many people are just so kind and welcoming , it's awesome . I also like fishing
